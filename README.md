# **Peer Review Application** 
### **Genre:**

 **Function:**

This web application is designed to allow students to give feedback on their teammates after a group assignment based on many factors including contribution, participation, communication, etc. Teachers and teacher assistants will also be given access to view the comments of the different groups in order to mark each student fairly. 

### **Design:**

THe website will contain many pages including:
- seperate log-in pages for students and teachers
- a form including grading points that students fill.
- a result page with graphs displaying the contribution of students.
  

## **Technologies:**

### **Front-end ** 


HTML5 and CSS will be used to design the different pages. React is a JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces using reusable components. It efficiently updates web pages with a Virtual DOM and follows a unidirectional data flow for easier state management. 


### **Back-end** 

PHP will be used to host the website for public access. For the database, we will use SQL and JavaScript will handle the back-end logics.
